### Things I Liked

**1. Appetite**

I really like how appetite is used rather than just estimating story points per task. The ideology around appetite is similar to a timebox, showing how much time the team wants to spend on a task, rather than using story points to estimate an arbitrary number to the difficulty. The idea and value of the appetite provides a concrete number to how long the task is expected to take, which allows planning and implementation to be more straightforward. Also, this helps to ensure that the planned implementation is based on the appetite/ time constraint provided, rather than vice versa.

**2. Team Responsibility**

I really like that this methodology focuses on giving a lot of responsibilities to the team working on the feature. In my personal experience working on scrum or agile teams, sometimes I did feel like a lot of design decisions were left up to people outside of the team and I was just working on implementing them. I felt very disconnected from the designs and that I didn’t have a say in what it should look like. I think giving the majority of the design and planning responsibilities to project managers, designers and developers on the team that will be implementing the system/ feature will greatly improve the morale of the team and quality of the product. The team will feel more connected to what is being created and as if they
have more stake in the product.

### Things I Didn't Like

**1. 6 Week Working Period**

Personally I’m not a big fan of having 6 week working periods over sprints. I personally really enjoy the idea of working for a short period of time, and getting a break to reflect. It helps segment the development process and give you some checkpoints to really talk about your opinion on the flow of development. Also, I think that working in 6 week chunks sounds very long and daunting, while 2 week sprints seem less intimidating and tiring.

Although I understand that the idea of working in 6 weeks is to prevent unnecessary meetings, I feel like some of the management meetings seem in a normal scrum flow is necessary in ensuring the team still understands the goal and vision.

### Other Questions

**6 Weeks vs. 2 Weeks**

- I wonder what benefits have been seen when working in a 6 week flow vs. 2 week flow
- Has there been improved productivity and faster turnover rates for projects?
