### Analysis (Task 3)

After allocating Pierre to both "Test UI" and "Test AI", there can be seen that a resource allocation issue occurred. This is indicated on the task sheet on figure E, as there is a red person icon to the left of task CMS-1.6 and CMS-1.7. The icon indicates that the issue is an resource over allocation, as the Gantt Chart shows that Pierre must work on two tasks simultaneously which means that his workload exceeds his working hours.

The way to solve this resource over allocation issue is by resource levelling. This is the process of making sure that the tasks do not exceed the available resources. This resource levelling may cause the critical path to change, increasing the total number of days to complete Phase 1. In figure F, it shows the project after applying resource levelling. It can be seen that the days for task CMS-1.7 now starts after CMS-1.6, increasing the phase 1 project days from 15.16 to 17.13.
